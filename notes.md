Users have many orders


Orders belong to Users
default to:
paid_for: false
picked_up: false

users can have address, name, phone info, specific requirements
orders can have weight, price, time, paid_for, picked_up
users can only see and change their own orders.
  -user cannot change order once it is picked up

master_user(laundromat) can view all users and all orders and assign paid_for and picked_up values.
admin attribute true/false
  -finalizes the weight and price upon pickup


make better time input.

make cases for :

no two same emails on sign up
-use flash messages? popup messages?

users cant change order once picked up .

in order comments, have value as the user's preferences.

after request is confirmed, and changed into an order, clear the request from the database.
